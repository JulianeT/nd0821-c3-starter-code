## Model Details
- **Model name**: Salary Prediction Model
- **Model version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2022-01-01

## Intended Use
This model is intended to predict the salary of individuals based on various features. It should be used in contexts where accurate salary predictions are needed, such as in human resources or job market analysis.

## Training Data
The model was trained on a dataset containing various features of individuals, such as their education level, years of experience, and job role. The dataset was collected in a manner that ensures a diverse and representative sample of the population.

## Evaluation Data
The model was evaluated on a separate dataset that was not used during training. This dataset was also collected in a manner that ensures a diverse and representative sample of the population.

## Metrics
The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric.

## Ethical Considerations
We have taken steps to ensure that the model does not perpetuate harmful biases. However, as with any machine learning model, there is a risk that it may unintentionally reinforce existing societal biases present in the training data.

## Caveats and Recommendations
This model should be used as a tool to aid decision-making, not as the sole determinant. Users should also consider other relevant factors when making decisions based on the model's predictions.
